})
//emit is like event name ,same as with on is like addEventListener
event.emit(emit_name)

//OR

const event=require("events");
const EventEmitter=new event.EventEmitter();
event.on("emit_name" ()=>{

event.emit(emit_name)

end:-This event is fired when there is no more data
error:-This event is fired when there is any error receiving or writing data 
finish:-this event is fired when all the data has been flushed to underlying system.
